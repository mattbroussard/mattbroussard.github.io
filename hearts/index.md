## About

This was a [Hearts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts) game written for a high school computer science class I took as a junior in 2011.

The assignment specs are [here](http://cs.leanderisd.org/current/a/project-hearts.html) as of this writing, but this link may break. My implementation goes considerably beyond what was asked, and supports among other things:

* Network play with other human or computer players
* Graphical user interface
* Card animations
* Chat with other players
* Multiple card passing schemes (cycled through each trick)
