## Spring 2015 CS First-Year Pod

In the [fall semester](../../fall2014/pod/), we elected to have occasional informal and optional meetings in the spring rather than continuing the scheduled weekly mandatory meetings. This page will hold information for those still involved.

### Interest Survey

If you're interested in continuing to meet in the spring, please fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1wO09yAEXaQvNXVik5CT8qv6GVk87J4eTnHw-Kbr4t20/viewform?usp=send_form). I'll likely stop sending emails through Canvas (as not to spam those no longer interested), so **if you're interested, this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1wO09yAEXaQvNXVik5CT8qv6GVk87J4eTnHw-Kbr4t20/viewform?usp=send_form) will be the only way to get on the mailing list.** This form is also important for me to know what topics you're interested in deeper coverage of.

### Spring 2015 Career Fair

The Spring 2015 [CNS Career Fair](http://cns.utexas.edu/career-design-center/career-events/career-fairs) is on **Thursday, Feburary 5** from 1-6pm at the Frank Erwin Center. I'll likely hold an informal meeting before then to provide résumé feedback and review the materials we discussed last semester about [making the most of career fair](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oOhYVgQJ2NR6zJ6jlbQPNVOqdkzbY9yw1ElXn-J7OVM/edit?usp=sharing) and [interviewing and negotiation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14NFFyqLUa9D1Yzh09Ig76rkLxp_VP2_Z71WAlIjT-co/edit?usp=sharing).

**If you're interested, please provide your availability [here](http://whenisgood.net/7c3da7m).**
