## Fall 2014 CS First-Year Pod ("CNS 101")

### Welcome

Our Pod/CNS101 will be a small group of first-year Turing Scholars students. I can't wait to meet you! In the meantime, you can read about the program [here](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/undergraduate-program/student-engagement-and-support/360-connections/cns-101).

Course Number: NSC001S (#48174)<br/>
Meets **Tuesdays, 4-5pm in [GDC](http://www.utexas.edu/maps/main/buildings/gdc.html) 2.410**

### Communications

Please request to join the [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/622145304569459/). Note that you need a <tt>@utexas.edu</tt> email address to join. It's easy and quick to get one, just go [here](https://get.utmail.utexas.edu/). If you don't have a Facebook or don't want to join the group, I'll also be sending out this information via email, but generally Facebook is a nicer way to disseminate information less formally.

Feel free to [email](http://mattb.name/contact) or Facebook message me anytime with questions or concerns. You can also contact our CNS Lead Facilitator, [Chelsea Weitekamp](mailto:chelseaweitekamp@gmail.com).

### Topics Overview

Here is a rough list of topics we'll be talking about (in no order). As the semester goes on, this list will get more detailed.

- Using the CS labs and other department and UT resources
- Building your résumé and making the most of the [Career Fair](http://cns.utexas.edu/career-design-center/career-events/career-fairs)
- Interviewing and negotiating with companies
- Meeting professors from the department
- Choosing classes for spring semester and beyond
- Extracurricular opportunities
- Various useful topics not typically covered in CS classes
- ...more!

In addition to the topics we cover in our weekly meetings, we'll be having fun social events throughout the semester.
