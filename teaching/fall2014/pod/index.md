## Fall 2014 CS First-Year Pod ("CNS 101")

### Welcome

Our Pod/CNS101 will be a small group of first-year Turing Scholars students. I can't wait to meet you! In the meantime, you can read about the program [here](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/undergraduate-program/student-engagement-and-support/360-connections/cns-101).

Course Number: NSC001S (#48174)<br/>
Meets **Tuesdays, 4-5pm in [GDC](http://www.utexas.edu/maps/main/buildings/gdc.html) 2.410**

### Communications

Please request to join the [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/622145304569459/). Note that you need a <tt>@utexas.edu</tt> email address to join. It's easy and quick to get one, just go [here](https://get.utmail.utexas.edu/). If you don't have a Facebook or don't want to join the group, I'll also be sending out this information via email, but generally Facebook is a nicer way to disseminate information less formally.

Please also fill out the [Google Form](http://mattb.name/podform) so we can get some basic info about you.

Feel free to [email](http://mattb.name/contact) or Facebook message me anytime with questions or concerns. You can also contact our CNS Lead Facilitator, [Chelsea Weitekamp](mailto:chelseaweitekamp@gmail.com).

### Company Events

Companies frequently hold events for UTCS students in order to increase awareness of their company and recruit for internship and full-time positions. Many of these events will have free food and swag. I recommend going to as many of these as possible with copies of your résumé in order to learn about opportunities at these companies and network with recruiters.

**Important:** This list is only a few upcoming highlights. For many more company events, see the [CS department calendar](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/calendar/) and the [CNS Career Services events page](https://www.facebook.com/cnscareers/events).

**Another very important note**: You should consider RSVPs binding obligations to attend, particularly with exclusive space-limited events like the Apple dinner. Companies spend time and money on planning, catering, and space reservations and it's important to respect commitments you make to attend. It reflects poorly on us all if you don't.
