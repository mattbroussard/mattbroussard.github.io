### Welcome

Our Pod/CNS101 will be a small group of first-year Turing Scholars students. I can't wait to meet you! In the meantime, you can read about the program [here](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/undergraduate-program/student-engagement-and-support/360-connections/cns-101).

Course Number: NSC001S (#48174)<br/>

### Communications

Please request to join the [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/622145304569459/). Note that you need a <tt>@utexas.edu</tt> email address to join. It's easy and quick to get one, just go [here](https://get.utmail.utexas.edu/). If you don't have a Facebook or don't want to join the group, I'll also be sending out this information via email, but generally Facebook is a nicer way to disseminate information less formally.

Feel free to [email](http://mattb.name/contact) or Facebook message me anytime with questions or concerns. You can also contact our CNS Lead Facilitator, [Chelsea Weitekamp](mailto:chelseaweitekamp@gmail.com).

### Company Events

Companies frequently hold events for UTCS students in order to increase awareness of their company and recruit for internship and full-time positions. Many of these events will have free food and swag. I recommend going to as many of these as possible with copies of your résumé in order to learn about opportunities at these companies and network with recruiters.
