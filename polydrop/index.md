## About PolyDrop

PolyDrop is a simple and addicting game of catch designed to be played with a [Leap Motion Controller](http://www.leapmotion.com/).

It was created by [Matt Broussard](http://mattb.name/), Josh Kelle, and Dallas Kelle at a hackathon sponsored by [Leap Motion](http://www.leapmotion.com/) and [Compare Metric](http://comparemetrics.com/) in February 2014 at Capital Factory in Austin, TX. After being selected as a finalist and ultimately winning the grand prize, we continued development of the game and were invited to bring PolyDrop to Airspace (pending review).

## How to Play

Use your hands to try to catch the falling shapes. Hold onto the shapes long enough, and they'll disappear, earning you points. As you earn points, you'll level up and get more difficult shapes that drop more frequently. But if shapes fall off the platform, you'll lose points and health...and if you run out of health, it's game over! How long can you keep it up?
