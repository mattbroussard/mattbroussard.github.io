## About PolyDrop

PolyDrop is a simple and addicting game of catch designed to be played with a [Leap Motion Controller](http://www.leapmotion.com/).

It was created by [Matt Broussard](http://mattb.io/), [Josh Kelle](http://joshkelle.com/), and [Dallas Kelle](http://dallaskelle.com/) at a hackathon sponsored by [Leap Motion](http://www.leapmotion.com/) and Compare Metrics (now rebranded as [Edgecase](http://edgecase.io/)) in February 2014 at Capital Factory in Austin, TX. After being selected as a finalist and ultimately winning the grand prize, we continued development of the game and were invited to bring PolyDrop to Airspace. As of December 2014, it has been downloaded over 32,000 times.

## How to Play

Use your hands to try to catch the falling shapes. Hold onto the shapes long enough, and they'll disappear, earning you points. As you earn points, you'll level up and get more difficult shapes that drop more frequently. But if shapes fall off the platform, you'll lose points and health...and if you run out of health, it's game over! How long can you keep it up?
