## About

**Dallas, can you?** was created as a prank on one of my roommates, [Dallas](http://dallaskelle.com/). Since [Josh](http://joshkelle.com/) and I frequently ask Dallas to do things, we thought it would be funny to create "Dallas as a Service".

The service allows users to input a task and have the task sent to Dallas's phone via SMS (using the Twilio API). To prevent abuse, the service requires Facebook login and only allows users who are friends with Dallas to send requests.

I used this silly weekend project as an excuse to play with several new tools, including Flask, Heroku, and MongoDB so that I can be already up-to-speed with them when a more serious project arises.
